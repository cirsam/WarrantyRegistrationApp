# Warranty Registration App

**Description**
This application when finished will allow companies to process warranty registration from remote locations or integrate it into their existing web applications with RESTFUL API.

## Project Outline:
1. Created the base. Make sure you run your migrations
2. Connect to an actual database instead of SQL file
3. Create the API empty shell
4. Add unit testing capabilities for the function or methods calls
5. Will consume the C# application with either React, Vue or Angular. I haven't chosen which one yet or I may do it for all of them
7. Maybe host it on an actual server either on AWS or Azure and make it available to the public
